Completing Milestone 3 in the course posed the most formidable challenge for me. Although I managed to complete the first two milestones without full comprehension, I realized the significance of understanding the overall logic before diving into a project. This led me to review previous milestones and gain the necessary insights, which ultimately helped me successfully implement Milestone 3.

During this phase, I familiarized myself with STL containers and algorithms, which I found enjoyable. The most fascinating part was implementing the linked-list algorithm using the container. However, the "attemptToMoveOrder" function in the "Workstation" file proved to be a significant challenge. Debugging and troubleshooting required substantial effort, especially when determining the correct placement of user orders in the "completed" or "incomplete" container based on item status. Despite the obstacles, I persisted in diligent debugging and careful examination of variable values, which ultimately allowed me to resolve the issue.

Another interesting aspect was using STL algorithms instead of traditional loop statements. While it posed difficulties initially, attending workshops and practicing extensively helped me overcome this challenge. As a result, I not only mastered implementing STL algorithms in the LineManager constructor but also in other functions like "run" and "display" in LineManager.cpp, using range-based for statements and for_each, respectively. This experience significantly enhanced my proficiency with STL algorithms.

In summary, Milestone 3 provided a demanding yet valuable learning experience. It underscored the importance of grasping the entire process before starting a project and offered ample opportunities to improve my skills with STL containers and algorithms. The challenges I faced, along with my dedicated debugging and problem-solving efforts, contributed to my growth as a programmer and strengthened my grasp of the course material.
